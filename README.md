## My solutions to AlgoExpert coding challenge set

### Solve in typescript and golang

#### Progress: 29/160 | Target: 100/160

_(mostly the common questions for normal people, I'll leave the wacky mind-twisting ones to Einstein)_

1~3 question(s) per day, my head hurts, I'm feeling dizzy, but I'm still alive (and actually getting better).  
Decided not to transcribe into golang yet, instead revisiting the same question a few weeks after finishing in typescript could serve a second chance for me to remember the whole thing.
