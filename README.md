## My solutions to AlgoExpert coding challenge set

### Solved in typescript or golang

#### Progress: 90/160 | Target: 100/160

1~3 question(s) per day, my head hurts, I'm feeling dizzy, yet I'm still alive (and actually getting better).

Solutions in typescript / golang alternatively, then transcribe into the other one a few weeks later if I were going to revisit the same question.
